                <div class="about-block lead" style="--x:5%; --y:0%"><p>When I was a kid, my cousins and I used to build forts in my backyard. And not the flimsy kind where you just lean a few branches together and toss a blanket on top. We went all in — sawing big branches in half to make perfect right angles, layering leaves to make a roof that could actually hold up.</p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead" style="--x:53%; --y:0%"><p>Those forts were serious business. We were building something that could last.</p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead" style="--x:5%; --y:12%"><p>Looking back, I think that’s where it started — this love for making things that hold up over time. I didn’t know it then, but I’ve been building “made-to-last” moments ever since. Whether it’s my drive to hike a new trail, learning another line dance, baking something for people I care about, or growing my book collection one story at a time — I’ve always liked creating things that stick around in some way.</p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead" style="--x:53%; --y:12%"><p><strong>Building Strength — Hiking, Camping, and National Parks</strong></p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead" style="--x:5%; --y:24%"><p>Being outside has always been my reset button. There’s something about the quiet of a trail or the stillness of a campsite that just clears everything out. I love hiking, camping, and exploring national parks — pushing myself to new places, literally and mentally.</p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead" style="--x:53%; --y:24%"><p>Setting up a tent, cooking over a fire, waking up surrounded by trees — it all brings me back to that same feeling I had as a kid building forts. You work with what you have, you make it sturdy, and you take pride in what you built.</p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead" style="--x:5%; --y:36%"><p><strong>Building Rhythm — Line Dancing</strong></p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead" style="--x:53%; --y:36%"><p>Line dancing is one of those things that started as “just for fun” and turned into something I can’t imagine not doing. Every time I learn a new step, I feel that same mix of focus and joy — like getting one more piece to fit just right.</p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead" style="--x:5%; --y:48%"><p>It’s not just about the movement, either. It’s about the people, the laughter, the rhythm you fall into with everyone around you. It’s community — and I love that.</p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead" style="--x:53%; --y:48%"><p><strong>Building Comfort — Baking</strong></p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead" style="--x:5%; --y:60%"><p>Baking is my creative outlet. It’s equal parts patience, curiosity, and comfort. There’s something so satisfying about taking simple ingredients and turning them into something warm and thoughtful.</p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead" style="--x:53%; --y:60%"><p>I love baking for the people I care about — it’s a quiet way of showing love. Plus, there’s a kind of peace in the process itself. Measuring, mixing, waiting — it reminds me to slow down and stay present.</p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead" style="--x:5%; --y:72%"><p><strong>Building Knowledge — Reading</strong></p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead" style="--x:53%; --y:72%"><p>I’ve been slowly building my book collection over the years, and it’s one of my favorite things. Each book feels like a new perspective, a new way of seeing the world. Reading keeps me curious, grounded, and always learning — even if it’s just through someone else’s story.</p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead" style="--x:5%; --y:84%"><p><strong>Building Connection — Concerts</strong></p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead" style="--x:53%; --y:84%"><p>There’s just something about live music. Concerts have become one of my favorite ways to feel connected — the crowd, the energy, the kind of magic that happens when everyone’s singing the same song.</p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead" style="--x:5%; --y:96%"><p>It’s loud and messy and absolutely unforgettable — and those are the moments that stay with me the longest.</p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead" style="--x:53%; --y:96%"><p><strong>Building Roots — Family</strong></p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead" style="--x:5%; --y:108%"><p>At the center of everything I do is family. They’re the people who taught me how to build — literally and figuratively. They’re the reason I push myself, laugh easily, and care deeply.</p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead" style="--x:53%; --y:108%"><p>They’ve always been the foundation, and I don’t take that lightly.</p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead" style="--x:5%; --y:120%"><p><strong>Full Circle</strong></p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead" style="--x:53%; --y:120%"><p>Those forts in the backyard were more than just piles of branches and leaves — they were my first blueprints for life. Now, every hike, dance, book, bake, and memory feels like another version of the same thing: building something strong, meaningful, and built to last.</p></div>
