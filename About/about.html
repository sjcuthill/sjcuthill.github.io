                <div class="about-block lead"><p>As a young girl, I grew up with in the woods of my backyard with my cousins. To us, that acre of land felt like an entire forest, and if we went far enough, I was certain we would cross the bridge right into Terabithia. We spent most of our time building forts in that woods. We arent talking about the flimsy ones where you simply lean a few branches together and toss a blanket on top. That was childs play.</p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead"><p>We went all in, sawing limbs off fallen trees from the last thunderstorm, making perfect right angles and curved archways from branches for the door, and layering leaves to make a roof that would actually hold up to the elements. Those forts were serious business to us.</p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead"><p>We didnt think about it as much back then, but we were building something that would last!</p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead"><p>Ive been building things that last ever since. I dont belive something is worth doing unless its done right, done with passion and care, and done with the purpose to make the world a better place. Whether it's my drive to hike a new trail, learning another line dance, baking something for people I care about, or growing my book collection one story at a time, Ive aways enjoyed creating things that are solid, static, and have a strong foundation.</strong></p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead"><p><strong>Exploring</strong></p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead"><p>Spending time outdoors has always been my reset button. There is something about the the peacefulness of a trail or the stillness of the a campsite that brings clarity to any situation. I love hiking, camping, and exploring national parks: pushing myself to new places, physicslly and mentally. Being outdoors, surronded by the trees and good company with the smell of smores roasting over the fire brings me back to the woods in my backyard.</p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead"><p><strong>Rhythm</strong></p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead"><p>Line dancing is one of those things that started as "just for fun" and turned into something I can't imagine not doing. Every time I learn a new step, I feel that same mix of focus and joy — like getting one more piece to fit just right.It's not just about the movement, either. It's about the people, the laughter, the rhythm you fall into with everyone around you. It's community — and I love that.</p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead"><p><strong>Baking</strong></p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead"><p>Baking is my creative outlet. It's equal parts patience, curiosity, and comfort. There's something so satisfying about taking simple ingredients and turning them into something warm and thoughtful.I love baking for the people I care about — it's a quiet way of showing love. Plus, there's a kind of peace in the process itself. Measuring, mixing, waiting — it reminds me to slow down and stay present.</p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead"><p><strong>Building Knowledge</strong></p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead"><p>I've been slowly building my book collection over the years, and it's one of my favorite things. Each book feels like a new perspective, a new way of seeing the world. Reading keeps me curious, grounded, and always learning — even if it's just through someone else's story.</p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead"><p><strong>Building Connection</strong></p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead"><p>There's just something about live music. Concerts have become one of my favorite ways to feel connected — the crowd, the energy, the kind of magic that happens when everyone's singing the same song.It's loud and messy and absolutely unforgettable — and those are the moments that stay with me the longest.</p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead"><p><strong>Building Roots</strong></p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead"><p>At the center of everything I do is family. They're the people who taught me how to build — literally and figuratively. They're the reason I push myself, laugh easily, and care deeply.They've always been the foundation, and I don't take that lightly.</p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead"><p><strong>Full Circle</strong></p></div>
                <div class="about-block lead"><p>Those forts in the backyard were more than just piles of branches and leaves — they were my first blueprints for life. Now, every hike, dance, book, bake, and memory feels like another version of the same thing: building something strong, meaningful, and built to last.</p></div>
