When I was a kid, my cousins and I used to build forts in my backyard.
And not the flimsy kind where you just lean a few branches together and toss a blanket on top.
We went all in — sawing big branches in half to make perfect right angles, layering leaves to make a roof that could actually hold up.

Those forts were serious business.
We were building something that could last.

Looking back, I think that’s where it started — this love for making things that hold up over time. I didn’t know it then, but I’ve been building “made-to-last” moments ever since. Whether it’s my drive to hike a new trail, learning another line dance, baking something for people I care about, or growing my book collection one story at a time — I’ve always liked creating things that stick around in some way.

Building Strength — Hiking, Camping, and National Parks

Being outside has always been my reset button. There’s something about the quiet of a trail or the stillness of a campsite that just clears everything out. I love hiking, camping, and exploring national parks — pushing myself to new places, literally and mentally.

Setting up a tent, cooking over a fire, waking up surrounded by trees — it all brings me back to that same feeling I had as a kid building forts. You work with what you have, you make it sturdy, and you take pride in what you built.

Building Rhythm — Line Dancing

Line dancing is one of those things that started as “just for fun” and turned into something I can’t imagine not doing.
Every time I learn a new step, I feel that same mix of focus and joy — like getting one more piece to fit just right.

It’s not just about the movement, either. It’s about the people, the laughter, the rhythm you fall into with everyone around you. It’s community — and I love that.

Building Comfort — Baking

Baking is my creative outlet. It’s equal parts patience, curiosity, and comfort.
There’s something so satisfying about taking simple ingredients and turning them into something warm and thoughtful.

I love baking for the people I care about — it’s a quiet way of showing love. Plus, there’s a kind of peace in the process itself. Measuring, mixing, waiting — it reminds me to slow down and stay present.

Building Knowledge — Reading

I’ve been slowly building my book collection over the years, and it’s one of my favorite things.
Each book feels like a new perspective, a new way of seeing the world.
Reading keeps me curious, grounded, and always learning — even if it’s just through someone else’s story.

Building Connection — Concerts

There’s just something about live music.
Concerts have become one of my favorite ways to feel connected — the crowd, the energy, the kind of magic that happens when everyone’s singing the same song.

It’s loud and messy and absolutely unforgettable — and those are the moments that stay with me the longest.

Building Roots — Family

At the center of everything I do is family.
They’re the people who taught me how to build — literally and figuratively.
They’re the reason I push myself, laugh easily, and care deeply.

They’ve always been the foundation, and I don’t take that lightly.

Full Circle

Those forts in the backyard were more than just piles of branches and leaves — they were my first blueprints for life.
Now, every hike, dance, book, bake, and memory feels like another version of the same thing: building something strong, meaningful, and built to last.
